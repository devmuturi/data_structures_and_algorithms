## O(n\*\*2) - Quadratic Time Complexity

Occurs when the time it takes to complete an operation is proportional to the square of the input size.
Often happens in algorithms that involves nested loops, where each loop iterates over the entire input.

Quadratic time complexity can become a performance bottleneck for large datasets
